## Project Overview 🔧

This repository is an automation test framework focused on end-to-end and API validation using **Node.js** and **Cypress (v15.8.0)**. The design emphasizes maintainability, repeatability, and CI-readiness — ideal for production usage or as a technical portfolio for recruiters.

Key aspects and technologies used:

- Core platform

  - Node.js + npm
  - Cypress ^15.8.0 (E2E runner, Mocha test syntax)
  - `specPattern` configured in `cypress.config.js` to discover specs under `cypress/e2e/`

- Reporting & aggregation

  - `cypress-mochawesome-reporter` for rich HTML reports
  - `mocha-junit-reporter` + `cypress-multi-reporters` to generate JUnit XML for CI
  - `junit-report-merger` used to merge JUnit files when running parallel jobs

- Plugins & helpers

  - `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` configured (legacy) for optional BDD-style feature files
  - `cypress-failed-log` and `cypress-terminal-report` for actionable debug logs
  - `cypress-xpath` for XPath selector support where needed
  - `@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin` (Allure integration, optional)

- Test organization & patterns

  - Tests separated by domain under `cypress/e2e/` (e.g., `API/`, `HYBRID/`)
  - Page Object pattern in `cypress/support/pageObjects/` for reusable UI interactions
  - Custom commands in `cypress/support/commands.js` and reusable hooks in `cypress/support/hooks/`
  - API helpers under `cypress/support/helpers/apiHelpers/` (request abstraction and assertions)

- Test data & utilities

  - Fixtures in `cypress/fixtures/` (static payloads like `loginData.json` and `productsData.json`)
  - Dynamic test data via `@faker-js/faker` and `cypress/utils/fakeData.js`
  - `cypress.config.js` exposes `env` values (e.g., `apiBaseUrl`) and custom node tasks (e.g., `writeFixture`, `deleteFakeData`)

- CI / Containerization

  - `DockerFile` provided to run tests in a controlled containerized environment
  - `JenkinsFile` demonstrates a pipeline that installs deps, runs tests, and archives `results/`
  - Artifacts saved to `results/` (Mochawesome HTML, JUnit XML) for easy inspection in CI

- Logging & operational
  - `winston` for structured logging where needed
  - Screenshots and videos configured via Cypress settings (`screenshotOnRunFailure`, `video` setting)

Where to look for the technical pieces:

- `cypress.config.js` — runner config, reporter config, custom tasks, env keys
- `package.json` — exact scripts and dependency versions
- `reporter-config.json` — reporter options (Mochawesome / multi-reporter settings)
- `results/` — generated test artifacts (HTML, XML)

Best practices followed:

- Tests are designed to be idempotent and deterministic
- Use Page Objects and helper modules to avoid duplication
- CI jobs are expected to publish `results/` as artifacts for triage
- Use `npx cypress run --spec` and spec globs/tags to execute specific subsets in CI

This section is intentionally technical and concise — reviewers should get a clear picture of the technologies used, where configuration and helpers live, and how the project behaves in local and CI environments.

- Test reports in JUnit and Mochawesome formats (`results/`)

---

## Tech Stack 🧰

- Node.js + npm
- Cypress (test runner)
- Mocha (test framework baked into Cypress)
- Mochawesome (HTML reporting)
- JUnit XML (CI integration)
- Docker (containerized runs)
- Jenkins (CI job examples - `JenkinsFile`)

## Project Structure 📁

Root files:

- `cypress.config.js` — Cypress configuration
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies
- `JenkinsFile` — declarative pipeline for CI
- `DockerFile` — to run tests in a container
- `reporter-config.json` — reporting options

Main folders:

cypress/

- e2e/
  - API/ — API-focused tests (e.g., `CRUD_user.cy.js`)
  - HYBRID/ — tests that combine UI + API (`placeorder.cy.js`)
  - fixtures/ — static JSON fixtures (e.g., `loginData.json`)
  - screenshots/ — Cypress screenshots on failure
- support/
  - commands.js — custom Cypress commands
  - e2e.js — support/bootstrapping for tests
  - helpers/ — helper modules (e.g., `userAPI.js`)
  - hooks/ — reusable hooks for setup/teardown
  - pageObjects/ — Page object classes for UI components

results/

- cypress-mochawesome-reporter/ — generated HTML reports
- junit/ — generated JUnit XML files for CI

utils/

- `fakeData.js` — test data generation helpers

## Getting Started — Local Setup 🛠️

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Recommended: Docker for containerized runs

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Open Cypress UI (interactive):

```bash
npm run open
```

Run all tests headlessly:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:headless
```

Run a single spec file:

```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/HYBRID/placeorder.cy.js"
```

---

## Available npm scripts 🚀

- `npm run open` — Open Cypress Test Runner UI
- `npm test` / `npm run test:headless` — Run all tests in headless mode
- `npm run test:api` — Run only API tests (if configured)
- `npm run lint` — Lint code (if linter configured)
- `npm run report:html` — Generate/serve Mochawesome report

(Inspect `package.json` for exact script definitions.)

---

## Testing Conventions & Guidelines 📘

- Tests live in `cypress/e2e/` and are grouped by domain (API, HYBRID, etc.).
- Use Page Objects (under `cypress/support/pageObjects/`) for selectors and reusable UI actions.
- Keep fixtures small and deterministic; prefer programmatic fake data for flexible test cases.
- Tests should be idempotent: they must not rely on global state left by previous runs.
- Use test tags or spec globbing to run subsets in CI.

Example: a simple test skeleton

```js
describe("Checkout flow", () => {
  before(() => cy.loginAs("standardUser"));
  it("adds product and places order", () => {
    // use Page Objects and assertions
  });
});
```

---

## Reporting & Test Artifacts 📊

- HTML reports are produced by Mochawesome and saved to `results/cypress-mochawesome-reporter/`.
- JUnit XML files are saved under `results/junit/` for CI ingestion.
- Screenshots and videos (on failure) are saved to `cypress/screenshots/` and `cypress/videos/` (configurable).

> Tip: CI jobs should publish the `results/` folder as build artifacts so failures are easy to inspect.

## CI / Docker / Jenkins ⚙️

This project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker for automated testing.

### Prerequisites
- Jenkins with Docker plugin installed and Docker daemon running on the agent.
- Git repository accessible to Jenkins.

### Jenkins Pipeline
The `Jenkinsfile` defines a pipeline that:
1. Checks out the code from Git.
2. Builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
3. Runs Cypress tests inside the container (currently configured to use Edge browser via `npm run cypress:edge`).
4. Mounts the `results/` directory to persist test artifacts.
5. Publishes the Mochawesome HTML report in Jenkins.
6. Cleans up Docker resources.

### Dockerfile Details
The `Dockerfile` is based on `cypress/included:15.8.1` and runs `npm run cypress:edge` by default.

**Important:** The Cypress Docker image does not include Microsoft Edge. To run successfully in Docker, modify the `CMD` in the `Dockerfile` or the script in `package.json` to use a supported browser like Chrome or Electron.

Example modifications:
- For Chrome: Change `CMD ["npm", "run", "cypress:edge"]` to `CMD ["npx", "cypress", "run", "--headless", "--browser", "chrome"]`
- Or update `package.json`: `"cypress:edge": "cypress run --browser chrome"`

### Running Locally with Docker
1. Build the image: `docker build -t cypress-tests .`
2. Run tests: `docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/results:/app/results cypress-tests`
3. View reports in `results/cypress-mochawesome-reporter/index.html`.

### Alternative: Run Without Docker
If Docker is not available, use the Node.js-based pipeline (comment out Docker stages in `Jenkinsfile` and enable the NodeJS tool and npm stages).

## Troubleshooting & Tips ⚠️

- If tests are flaky, enable Cypress retries and add explicit wait guards where necessary.
- For network-dependent API tests, consider using mock servers or contract tests.
- Check `results/junit/*.xml` and `results/cypress-mochawesome-reporter/index.html` for test failure details.

**Quick evaluation checklist:**

- Clear separation of test types (UI, API, Hybrid) ✅
- Page Object pattern and helper utilities ✅
